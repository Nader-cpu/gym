					Warm up: Before beginning your gym workout, it's important to properly
					warm up your body to prevent injury. A good warm-up should include
					some light cardio (like jogging or cycling) and dynamic stretches
					(like leg swings or arm circles) to get your heart rate up and your
					muscles ready for the workout.
				</li>
				<li>
					Plan your workout: Decide which exercises you want to do and in what
					order. You can focus on a specific muscle group or do a full-body
					workout. You can use machines, free weights, or bodyweight exercises
					to target different areas of the body.
				</li>
				<li>
					Consider the number of sets and repetitions you want to do for each
					exercise. Use proper form: Proper form is crucial to prevent injury
					and ensure that you're targeting the intended muscle group.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you're unsure how to perform an exercise correctly, ask a trainer
					for assistance. Start with lighter weights and gradually increase the
					weight as your form improves.
				</li>
				Breathe properly: Proper breathing technique can help you lift heavier
				weights and perform more reps. In general, you should inhale before
				starting the exercise and exhale during the effort (when lifting or
				pushing the weight) and inhale during the recovery (when lowering or
				releasing the weight).
